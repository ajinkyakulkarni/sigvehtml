| Did you know that any piece of code is likely to  | |               |
| be read over a hundred times more often than it   | | * Home        |
| is written? Most of a developer's time is spent   | | * Download    |
| trying to understand code. Sigvehtml is a HTML    | | * Legal       |
| dialect which focuses on readability and the      | | * About Us    |
| ability to get a quick overview.                  | |               |
|                                                   | |               |
| With sigvehtml, there is no longer any need to    | |               |
| wade trough thickets of nested divs and spans     | |               |
| and what-have-yous to get to a real understanding | |               |
| of what is going on. Throw the boilerplate soup   | |               |
| out of the window, and increase your productivity | |               |
| hundred-fold by re-writing all your code to       | |               |
| sigvehtml. You wont regret it.                    | |               |
|                                                   | |               |
| Remember: you only need to rewrite to sigvehtml   | |               |
| once. And then you can read again and again and   | |               |
| again, each time fully aware of what the finished | |               |
| output is going to look like. The dark ages of    | |               |
| web development is over!                          | |               |
