# Sigvehtml

Finally a HTML that you can sight-read.

So how great is it? This horribly old-fashioned HTML5:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    <title>Sigvehtml</title>
    <meta charset="utf8" />
    <script src=//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js></script>
    <link rel=stylesheet src=//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css>
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1>Sigvehtml</h1>

    <img src="elephant.png" />

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-9">
                <p>
                    Did you know that any piece of code is likely to be read over a hundred times more often than is written?
                    Most of a developer's time is spent and trying to understand code.
                    Sigvehtml is a HTML dialect which focuses on readability and the ability to get a quick overview. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    With sigvehtml, there is no longer any need to wade trough thickets of nested divs and spans and what-have-you's to get to a real understanding of what is going on.
                    Throw the boilerplate soup out of the window, and increase your productivity hundred-fold by re-writing all your code to sigvehtml.
                    You wont regret it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remember: you only need to rewrite to sigvehtml once.
                    And then you can read again and again and again, each time fully aware of what the finished output is going to look like.
                    The dark ages of web development is over!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-3">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="home">Home</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="download">Download</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="legal">Legal</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="about-us">About Us</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <i/div>
    </div>

    </body>
</html>
```

Looks like this in sigvehtml:

```
